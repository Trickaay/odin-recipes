        <p>"I created this hamburger stroganoff as an amalgamation of about a half-dozen stroganoff recipes. Really hits the spot on a cold day, served over egg noodles with peas and carrots.""

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <p><ul>
            <li>1 pound lean ground beef.</li>
            <li>1 (8 ounce) package sliced white mushrooms.</li>
            <li>1 onion, chopped.</li>
            <li>2 gloves garlic minced</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon vegetable oil</li>
            <li>1 cup red wine</li>
            <li>1 cup beef stock</li>
            <li>1 cup sour cream</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons cornstarch</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt, or more to taste</li>
        </ul></p>
        <h4>Method</h4>
        <p><ol>
            <li><strong></strong>   Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add beef, mushrooms, and onion. Cook and stir until beef is browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes. Drain and discard grease. Transfer mixture to a bowl. Add garlic and oil to the skillet; saute until garlic is golden brown, about 1 minute.</li>
            <br><li>    Turn skillet heat to high; add red wine and beef stock. Bring to a boil while scraping the browned bits off of the bottom of the pan with a wooden spoon. Reduce heat and simmer until flavors meld, about 5 minutes.</li>
            <br> <li>    Whisk sour cream and cornstarch together in a bowl. Mix into the wine/broth mixture. Stir in the browned beef mixture. Bring to a simmer, stirring frequently. Add salt and pepper.</li>
        </ol>
